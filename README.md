# Calculator-for-Figures-Parameters
My Calculator is a PyQt5-based graphical user interface (GUI) application that calculates the area and perimeter of different geometric shapes.

Usage:
Run the application by executing the following command:
>>>python main.py
The main window of the application will appear with a variety of shapes to choose from.
Select a shape by clicking on the corresponding radio button.
Enter the required parameters for the selected shape.
Click the "Calculate" button to compute and display the area and perimeter.

Shapes and Formulas:
Square (კვადრატი)
Perimeter: 4 * side_length
Area: side_length^2
Triangle (სამკუთხედი)
Perimeter: side1 + side2 + side3
Area: √(p * (p - side1) * (p - side2) * (p - side3)), where p = (side1 + side2 + side3) / 2
Trapezoid (ტრაპეცია)
Perimeter: side1 + side2 + side3 + side4
Area: 0.5 * height * (side1 + side2)
Weird Shape (Wre)
Perimeter: 2 * π * radius
Area: π * radius^2
